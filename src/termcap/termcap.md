# Termcap Folder #

This folder contains all functions and classes relating to Larn's termcap implementation.

# What is it #

The new termcap code I am implementing is based on public domain termcap routines, ported to work well with how Larn does it's io.  Since Larn doesn't exactly do it's io based on these specifications, I've modified the code accordingly where required.
