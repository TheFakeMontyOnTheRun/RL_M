Below are instructions on how to configure, build and install Larn.  I am assuming whoever decides to compile it themselves is capable of doing it without help.

In the 'build' directory there are system-specific makefiles.  Just type 'make' and it will compile
providing you have satisfied the dependencies.

That's all.

Enjoy playing Larn!
