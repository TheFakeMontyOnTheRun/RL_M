Below are instructions on how to configure, build and install Larn.  I am assuming whoever decides to compile it themselves is capable of doing it without help.

On UNIX-Like systems and Windows:

- People on Unix-Like systems can simply execute the Makefile in the build directory.
- People on Windows should modify it to -DWINDOWS instead of -DNIX.

That's all.

Enjoy playing Larn!
