# RL_M
I am the official maintainer of Larn.

<b>Master Branch</b></br>
Currently a conversion of the C code of Larn to C++ is underway, in order to de-spaghettifi the
code and make it a good, clean game with a great codebase.  This master branch is also Apache 2.0 Licensed.

# Build Status #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atsb/RL_M.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atsb/RL_M)

# Compiling from Source #
Compiling Larn from source will require GCC 7 as a minimum plus ncurses and jsoncpp.  See the 'build' folder for makefiles.

I will also be personally packaging and maintaining the AUR PKGBUILD and a Debian package (I am working on getting it ready for sponsorship and submission to Debian).  Even though the milestone of getting this branch re-written and modified to be Free Software has been acomplished, I am by no means 'done'.  I will be personally developing FreeLarn way into the future (think decades, I'm not THAT old!).

The Debian upstream code will reside elsewhere (probably Savannah where I keep my GNU Software (I am a GNU Maintainer) in order to provide a fantastic upstream source package for Debian).
