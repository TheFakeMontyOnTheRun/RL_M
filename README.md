# RL_M
I am the official maintainer of Larn (12.5 +) and official maintainer of my XRogue fork (8.0.5 +).

Code:
Latest SNAPSHOT source code for Larn is in a separate branch (Larn-SNAPSHOT).  There is the full complete code to build releases from, right from my local trunk.  XRogue will have a branch named XRogue-SNAPSHOT (release is when it is ready).

Releases:
I will do a full release for every MAJOR version.  A full release includes OSX, GNU/Linux and Windows binaries with documentation and required files.  These releases will contain major functionality changes and improvements.

Patch release (MINOR) versions will only get a branch update of the sourcecode.  Which you can use to build a release yourself for your platform.  These patch releases will have bugfixes only with no major functionality updates.

Bugs:
Raise bugs in the issue tab.  Please tell me your platform, what you were doing and what the bug is.
