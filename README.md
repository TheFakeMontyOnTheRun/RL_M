<b>Updates:</b><br\>
Don't raise bugs for this branch.  It's right now purely alpha experimentation and won't be stable for a long long time.

<b>Future Planned Changes</b><br\>
1. Make it harder.  I find Larn to be very easy, in comparison to other games in the genre.
  I also dislike cheaters with the save files, so soon, I am removing the save/load code from the game.
  If you want to complete the game, you can do it in a single sitting (it's only 1 - 2 hours long at best).
 
2. Making the beginning of the game easier (better stats) and making the middle to end-game harder (tougher enemies).
  It's not as balanced as I'd like and I think Char Levels 1 - 7 would make a nice 'tutorial' area for beginners.
  Similar to MMO's.  Right now you're dropped in at the deep-end and if you're not careful even a kobold can kill you.
