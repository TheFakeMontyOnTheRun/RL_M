# RL_M
I am the official maintainer of Larn and official maintainer of my XRogue fork (8.0.5 +).

<b>Larn Next:</b><br\>
This is the repository for Larn after the 14.0 release.  Why is it called 'NEXT', because the next iteration of Larn (14.5) will contain very significant changes to the code.  Changes that I did not want to affect 'classic' Larn.

No commits until it is in a semi-working state :)
