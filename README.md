# RL_M

<b>Larn Next:</b><br\>
This is the branch for Larn after the 14.0 release.  Why is it called 'NEXT', because the next iteration of Larn (14.5) will contain very significant changes to the code.  Changes that I did not want to affect 'classic' Larn.

What changes are planned?
When the first commits start happening you will see the changes ;)

No commits until it is in a semi-working state (ie. when it can compile).
