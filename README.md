# RL_M
I am the official maintainer of Larn.

<b>Master Branch</b></br>
Currently a conversion of the C code of Larn to C++ is underway, in order to de-spaghettifi the
code and make it a good, clean game with a great codebase.

# Build Status #

# Compiling from Source #
Compiling Larn from source will require GCC 7 as a minimum plus ncurses and jsoncpp.  See the 'build' folder for makefiles.
