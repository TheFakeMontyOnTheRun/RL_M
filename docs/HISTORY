This file explains the historical nature of this FreeLarn repository.

This repository contains the Larn sourcecode which can trace it's ancestry back to the original 12.0 release from 1986.
If you check the CHANGELOG file, you will see the additions made throughout the decades.

I am committed to maintaining FreeLarn for the foreseeable future.
