When dropping gold, if you type '*' as your amount, all your gold gets dropped.
In general, typing in '*' means all of what your interested in.  This is true
when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.

When in the store, trading post, school, or home, an <escape> will get you out.

When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type 'I' as
the first letter of your spell.  The available list of spells will be shown,
after which you may enter the spell code.  This only works on the 1st letter
of the spell you are casting.

When an inventory list is on the screen from a drop, quaff, read, or similar
command, you can type the letter of the object that you wish to act apon,
without having to type a space to get back to the prompt.

If NumLock is off, the Keypad functions in the obvious way for movement. Hold
Shift when pressing any direction on the Keypad to run in that direction. The
5 key on the Keypad is the same as "stay here", which really means skip your
turn.

           		Explanation of the Larn scoreboard facility

    Larn supports TWO scoreboards, one for winners, and one for deceased
characters.  Each player (by the name entered when you start the game)
is allowed one slot on each scoreboard, if the score is in the top ten for
that scoreboard.  This design helps insure that frequent players of Larn
do not hog the scoreboard, and gives more players a chance for glory.  Level
of difficulty is also noted on the scoreboards, and this takes precedence
over score for determining what entry is on the scoreboard.  For example:
if "Yar, the Bug Slayer" has a score of 128003 on the scoreboard at diff 0,
then a game at diff 1 and a score of 4112 would replace the previous
entry on the scoreboard.  Note that when a player dies, the inventory is
stored in the scoreboard so that everyone can see what items the player had
at the time of death.
